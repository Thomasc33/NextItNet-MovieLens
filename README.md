# NextItNet MovieLens

A simple integration of NextItNet for the MovieLens dataset. Completed inside a jupyter notebook.

**this isnt a fully implemented nextitnet, it is a representation learning model based on nextitnet (dilated kernels), but since it isn't sequential recommendations and doesnt factor timestamp, it isn't nextitnet**
